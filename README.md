## Plant-Patholog Image Classification


### This repository is dedicated to a deep learning project focused on the classification of plant pathology images. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a robust model capable of identifying and categorizing various plant diseases based on visual patterns present in images. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field, feel free to explore, contribute, and collaborate to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of plant pathology diagnosis through image analysis.
